    <hr />
    <p> My name is Graham Bolinger, and I am a current MS candidate in Kennesaw State University's 
        Software Engineering program. At the moment, I am learning the fundamentals of full stack 
        development in the hope that I may land a job in the tech field. I am particularly
        interested in Software Engineering as a career because it allows me to be a problem solver 
        with real life issues and to take little more than thoughts and turn them into reality. 
        Ultimately, I have always felt drawn to technology, and I hope to one day play my part in 
        shaping the future through my endeavors.</p>
